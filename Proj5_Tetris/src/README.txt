1. We used singleton design pattern to set up the GUI. It is being used in the PlayingArea.java file.
 
2. We used factory design pattern to set up the shapes. All classes for the shapes implements the TetroShape interface. Then Tetrominoe class makes an instance of the object based on the object being selected.

Based on the above mention design Pattern, current program has following successful functionality:
1)Creates the 7 different Tetrominoes
2)Drops the objects in the playing area
3)Menubars

The main of the program is in the file Tetris.java , you can just run this file to play the game.
